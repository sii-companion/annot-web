  This page contains some example results from a previously prepared
  <i>Companion</i> annotation run.
  The tabs below display live data and behave exactly like an actual job
  result page (in fact, they are the result of an
  <%= link_to "actual job", job_url(id: @job[:job_id]) %> that was
  run <%= distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now,@job[:finished_at]) %> ago!).
  Click the tabs to see what data they contain.

    <h4>Genome statistics</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="text-info">Genome statistics</span> tab summarizes
      basic numeric statistics about the annotated genome, such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>gene counts</li>
      <li>gene density</li>
      <li>GC content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This summary is useful to quickly assess the success of the annotation
      job: does the amount of annotated features match the expectations?

  <h4>Result files</h4>
  <p>
    The next tab (<span class="text-info">Result files</span>) allows the user
    to download the results of the annotation jobs to their own computer, e.g.
    for further downstream analyses, manual curation or preparation for
    database submission. These are offered in the following formats:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml">GFF3</a> and
      <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/doc/usrman.txt">EMBL</a>
      format for annotated features</li>
      <li>FASTA format for sequences</li>
      <li><a href="http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-10">GAF format</a> for GO terms for each functionally annotated gene</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/">AGP format</a> files for pseudochromosome layouts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If no pseudochromosome contiguation was selected, files for both levels
      are identical. We also calculate
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Applications">MD5</a> tags
      which may be required at the time of submission in case there is no
      need for further curation.

    <h4>Orthology</h4>
    <p>
      The Venn diagram on the <span class="text-info">Orthology</span> tab
      depicts shared gene cluster membership between the
      newly annotated genome and the reference to easily assess the amount
      of species-specific gene content. The set on the left (green)
      represents the target genome while the one on the right (blue) represents
      the reference. The numbers in the set circles specify the number of shared
      or species-specific clusters with at least two genes. The amount of genes not
      appearing in any cluster (singletons) is shown outside both sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      By clicking on the numbers in the diagram, it is possible to browse
      the content of all sets using interactive tables. These paginated and
      searchable tables are shown below the Venn diagram when a number is
      clicked. A flat text file (in OrthoMCL 2.0 format) is also provided for
      custom analyses.

    <h4>Phylogeny</h4>
    <p>
     The tree on the <span class="text-info">Phylogeny</span> tab shows how the
     newly annotated target genome fits into the phylogeny of related species.
     From a set of up to 50 single-copy genes shared among all these species,
     a quick tree is built and visualized in an interactive tree, supporting
     various tree styles. All data used to build the tree are also available
     for download.

    <h4>Synteny</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="text-info">Synteny</span> tab contains circular plots
      showing alignments between each reference chromosome and their newly
      annotated counterpart. The reference chromosome is shown at the top and
      the new pseudochromosome is shown at the bottom. Grey ribbons between
      both represent similar regions as identified by BLASTN matches. Genes on
      the forward strand (blue) and the reverse strand (red) are annotated on
      the chromosomes, as well as gaps (yellow), singletons (black) and
      missing core genes (green), each in separate tracks. A similar output is
      created for uncontiguated input sequences concatenated into a 'bin'
      sequence (not drawn to scale) compared to all reference chromosomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These plots are useful to visualize the reference-target colinearity,
      which helps in identifying potential problems in pseudochromosome
      contiguation or large-scale chromosomal rearrangements at a glance.

    <h4>Validator results</h4>
    <p>
      We are doing our best to ensure that gene annotation files delivered by
      <i>Companion</i> are both syntactically and semantically (=biologically)
      valid and do not contain major issues. However, due to the complexity of
      the process and the high variability of input data, it is sometimes
      possible to end up with less than perfect gene models. Often such
      remaining issues can be quickly addressed by a human curator.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the best use of curator time as
      a scarce resource, we perform thorough automatic checking of our generated
      annotations, given as annotation graphs in GFF3 format. The results of
      this check are presented in a table, grouped by feature type.
      The number of successful and failed checks is concisely presented and for
      each failed check, the ID of the questionable feature is reported by
      clicking on the red labels denoting checking failures.
      This makes it easy to quickly estimate the amount of required curation
      and allows to work in a directed and focused fashion.
